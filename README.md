# Apple-quality-classification

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at classifying the quality of apples based on various features such as size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict the quality of apples based on their features. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we aim to assist in automating the quality assessment process, which can be beneficial for farmers, suppliers, and consumers alike.

## Dataset contains
